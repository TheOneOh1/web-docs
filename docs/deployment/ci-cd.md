# CI/CD Implementation Guide

## Setting Up CI/CD Pipeline

### Prerequisites

- Version control system (Git)
- CI/CD platform access
- Build environment
- Test environment

### Basic Pipeline Structure

1. **Source Control**
   - Code repository
   - Branch management
   - Code review process

2. **Build Stage**
   - Dependency management
   - Compilation
   - Artifact generation

3. **Test Stage**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - Security scanning

4. **Deploy Stage**
   - Environment configuration
   - Deployment automation
   - Health checks

## Best Practices

### Version Control
