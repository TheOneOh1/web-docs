# Deployment Strategies

## Overview

This section covers various deployment strategies and best practices in DevOps.

## Deployment Types

### Blue-Green Deployment

A blue-green deployment strategy involves maintaining two identical production environments:
- **Blue**: The current production environment
- **Green**: The new version being deployed

### Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before making it available to everyone.

### Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment updates instances of the previous version of an application with the new version, one instance at a time.
